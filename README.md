**Software Engineer | Consultant | Data Engineer @ AdaptHealth**

I started programming HTML on Khan Academy in 2013 and haven't stopped since

I made [DesiDictions](https://desidictions.com) and helped ship [SuperVote.app](https://supervote.app). Data engineering is fun, but I really like automating processes, full stack development, GenAI, and doing courses on [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io).
